Live working App Url("https://65f6c48b0ab77d6d3109514e--soft-youtiao-d888dc.netlify.app/")
Description:
The Shopping Cart using Redux is a web application built with React and Redux that simulates an online shopping experience. Users can browse through a catalog of products, add items to their cart, update quantities, and remove items from the cart. The application utilizes Redux for state management, providing a centralized store to manage the cart data.

Key Features:

Product Catalog: 
Displays a list of products available for purchase, including details such as title, description, price, and discount percentage.

Add to Cart: 
Allows users to add products to their shopping cart with the option to specify the quantity.

Update Quantity: 
Enables users to update the quantity of items in their cart, adjusting the total amount accordingly.

Remove from Cart: 
Allows users to remove items from their cart, updating the total quantity and amount accordingly.
Order Summary: 
Provides users with an order summary, displaying the total quantity of items in the cart and the total amount to be paid.

 Navigation: 
Allows users to navigate between different sections of the application, including the product catalog, shopping cart, and checkout.
Technologies Used:

React: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
Redux: State management library for JavaScript applications.
React-Redux: Official Redux bindings for React.
HTML/CSS: Markup and styling languages for web development.
JavaScript (ES6+): Programming language used for client-side scripting.
Material-UI: React UI framework for building responsive web applications.
React Router: Library for routing in React applications.
Git/GitHub: Version control system and platform for hosting Git repositories.
